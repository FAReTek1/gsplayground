This is the repository where I develop and share my goboscript code. My scratch profile: https://scratch.mit.edu/users/faretek1/

## Goboscript modules
- cmath
    - a module for managing math with complex numbers.

- color
    - a module for managing color conversion and color effects (e.g. RGB sepia effect)

- geo2d
    - a module for dealing with 2d geometry (line intersection, line/poly clipping, etc)
